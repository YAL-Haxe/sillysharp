As if it wasn't immediately apparent, this entire file is auto-generated
from Haxe and may leave much to be desired in terms of readability.
Please avoid editing it to avoid trouble with subsequently updating the file.
P.S.: if a function or a variable is suffixed with `_hx`, you're probably not supposed to touch it.
